# Musfealle

##### A LightDM Webkit Greeter Theme that doesn't force you to use a mouse.

This greeter theme was built based on the Antergos Greeter Theme (https://github.com/Antergos/lightdm-webkit-theme-antergos)


## Installation

1. Download the theme
2. Unzip the contents on the folder /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/musfealle
3. Edit the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf and set the
"webkit-theme" property to "musfealle".

Obs: Make sure the property "greeter-session" in
/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf is set to "lightdm-webkit-greeter" or
"lightdm-webkit2-greeter".

And that should be it!


*Musfealle means "mouse trap" in old english according to some dictionay sites.*
